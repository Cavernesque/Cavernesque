I'm Darren Paetz AKA Cavernesque. Engineering Student, Electrician, Hobbyist Programmer, Engineering Researcher.

I'm currently back in school for Electrical Engineering. Last summer, I designed and prototyped an open source 3D scanner with MacEwan University.

You can see the details of that project in the OS3DS repository. My other public repositories are my personal programming projects.
