I'm Cave, IRL Darren Paetz. Engineering Student, Electrician, Hobbyist Programmer, Engineering Researcher.

I'm currently designing and prototyping an open source 3D scanner with MacEwan University.

The firmware for the scanner is being written in C++, as it is being deployed on an Arduino Uno. The software that configures the scanner and gathers data from it is
entirely written in Python. The repo's private for now, but check at the end of the summer: the project will be fully distributed by then.
